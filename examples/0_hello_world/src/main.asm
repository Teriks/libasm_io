;the following is defined when the library examples are being built with the library
%ifdef _LIBASM_IO_BUILDING_ 

;if the library build system is building the examples, then an option to NASM specifies the directory
;to find this include, so we can include it by its name only
%include "libasm_io.inc"    
 
%else

;otherwise if this code is compiled against the already installed library
;it's header needs to be included from its installed location
%include "/usr/local/include/libasm_io.inc"

;main gets called by the C runtime library, so it needs to be global to let the linker find it
;the cglobal macro from the library is used to add an underscore to the front of main if needed
;some platforms (Like Mac) use underscores in front of all their C library symbols
;the macro also defines main as _main if an underscore is needed, so we can reference it as 'main'
;consistently across platforms
cglobal main


section .data

;a message to print when we enter main
;db stands for define bytes and the 0 at the end is the null terminator,
;so print_string knows when the string ends
hello: db "Hello World!",0

	;set up a new stack frame, first save the old stack base pointer by pushing it
	push rbp
	
	;then slide the base of the stack down to RSP by moving RSP into RBP
	mov rbp, rsp

	;Windows requires a minimum of 32 bytes on the stack before calling any other functions
	;so this is for compatibility, its perfectly valid on Linux and Mac also
	sub rsp, 32
	
	
	;move the pointer to our hello message into RDI, RDI is the first parameter to print string
	mov rdi, QWORD hello
	call print_string
	
	;prints new line to the console
	call print_nl

	
	;restore the stack frame of the function that called this function
	;first add back the amount that we subtracted from RSP
	;including any additional subtractions we made to RSP after the initial one (just sum them)
	add	rsp, 32
	
	;after we add what we subtracted back to RSP, the value of RBP we pushed is the only thing left
	;so we pop it back into RBP to restore the stack base pointer
	pop	rbp
